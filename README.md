# SuperUp - Test

Test for Junior Devops Job in SuperUp.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

env file that will be in ~ folder, and will contain the aws credentials (Shouldn't be inside the GIT)
will be attached in mail.
also, in Travis CI please insert the AWS credentials in the environment variables in the project.

## Running the tests

There is a test stage in .travis.yml, still WIP - I want to check if curl localhost gives something, if not - exit 1.
